In this task, we successfully performed a dictionary attack to find the encryption key used to encrypt the message "This is a top secret." We found that the key was "Syracuse" (padded with '#' characters).

Implementation Details:

1. Known Values:
   - Plaintext: "This is a top secret."
   - Ciphertext: 764aa26b55a4da654df6b19e4bce00f4ed05e09346fb0e762583cb7da2ac93a2
   - IV: aabbccddeeff00998877665544332211
   - Found Key: "Syracuse" (padded as "Syracuse########")
   - Key in hex: 53797261637573652323232323232323

2. Attack Strategy:
   Instead of trying to decrypt the ciphertext, we:
   - Read words from a dictionary file that was provided
   - Padded each word with '#' to 16 bytes
   - Used the padded word as a key to encrypt the known plaintext
   - Compared the resulting ciphertext with the target ciphertext
   - When they matched, we found the key

3. Technical Implementation:
   - Used Python with the cryptography library
   - Implemented PKCS#7 padding for the plaintext
   - Used AES-128-CBC mode for encryption
   - Processed dictionary words efficiently

4. Security Analysis:
   This attack succeeded because:
   - The key was a simple English word (Syracuse)
   - The padding scheme was known (# characters)
   - We had both plaintext and ciphertext to verify our attempts

The success of this attack demonstrates why using simple words as encryption keys is dangerous, even with a strong algorithm like AES. A secure implementation should:
   - Use randomly generated keys
   - Implement proper key derivation functions if deriving keys from passwords
   - Use sufficient key length and entropy
