Approach:
I created a script to test encryption of the same plaintext with:
1. Two different IVs (changing just the last byte)
2. The same IV reused

Results:
1. Different IVs:
   - Same plaintext encrypted with different IVs produced different ciphertexts
   - Even changing just the last byte of the IV resulted in completely different output
   - Test confirmed: ciphertexts did not match (False)

2. Same IV:
   - Same plaintext encrypted with same IV produced identical ciphertexts
   - Test confirmed: ciphertexts matched exactly (True)
   - This reveals when the same message is sent multiple times

Why IV Must Be Unique:
1. Pattern Hiding:
   - Different IVs ensure same plaintext produces different ciphertexts
   - Prevents attackers from identifying repeated messages
   - Hides patterns in the original data

2. Security Implications:
   - Reusing IVs allows attackers to detect identical plaintexts
   - In some modes (like OFB), IV reuse can lead to complete message recovery
   - Compromises the security of even strong encryption algorithms

3. Initialization Vector Role:
   - IV provides randomization for the first block
   - Ensures identical plaintexts encrypt differently
   - Acts as a "starting point" for the encryption process

The experiment clearly demonstrates why IV reuse is dangerous - it allows patterns from the plaintext 
to leak through to the ciphertext, potentially compromising the security of the entire system.
