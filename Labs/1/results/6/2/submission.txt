Part 1: OFB Mode Analysis
------------------------
Given:
- P1: "This is a known message!"
- C1: a469b1c502c1cab966965e50425438e1bb1b5f9037a4c159
- C2: bf73bcd3509299d566c35b5d450337e1bb175f903fafc159

Attack Process:
1. In OFB mode, ciphertext is produced by XORing plaintext with keystream
2. Keystream is determined by IV and key, independent of plaintext
3. When IV is reused, the same keystream is produced
4. Therefore: P1 ⊕ C1 = P2 ⊕ C2 (same keystream)
5. We can recover P2 by: P2 = C2 ⊕ (P1 ⊕ C1)

Results:
- Successfully decrypted P2: "Order: Launch a missile!"
- Complete message recovery was possible
- Demonstrates complete failure of security with IV reuse in OFB mode

Part 2: CFB Mode Theoretical Analysis
-----------------------------------
In CFB mode:
- Initial block would be similarly vulnerable (same IV)
- However, subsequent blocks use previous ciphertext as feedback
- Therefore:
  * First block could be fully recovered (like OFB)
  * Subsequent blocks would be protected by the feedback mechanism
  * Only the portion of P2 in the first block would be revealed

This demonstrates why IV reuse is particularly dangerous in OFB mode (full message exposure) but 
still problematic in CFB mode (partial message exposure).
